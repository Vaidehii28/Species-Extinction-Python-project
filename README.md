# Species-Extinction-Python-project
Species extinction is the complete extermination or dying of a species. The loss of a species impacts food chains, food webs, and pollination services.
And we decided to address this issue and show the statistics using python libraries.
The main aim was to create and add data of different species.
Graphical representation of the species who are on the verge of extinction with the help of Matplotlib in Python. Used Pandas is used to analyze data and NumPy to set up scales of bar graph used to display the data.
